# CS 383 Assignment #3

## Objectives
- Install `git` on your computer.
- Use `git` on a small team project.

## Requirements
- Install `git` on your computer.
- Create a project with our team that implements a program using a stack or queue (class) that is based upon an underlying linked list class.
- The program should be composed of at least five source files:
    - main
    - stack.h 
    - stack.cpp 
    - list.h 
    - list.cpp
- A makefile should also be created to build the source and documentation.

> Also, please note that this code is very rigid and not very stable. The purpose of the assignment was to focus on using Git rather than the code.
